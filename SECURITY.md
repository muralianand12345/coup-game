# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability").
- Do not open public issues or pull requests for vulnerabilities; they may be closed to protect users.
- Include affected package/version, environment, reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior, and any logs or proof-of-concept that help us triage safely.

## Supported Versions
- The main branch and the most recent deployment are supported for security fixes.
- Older commits or forks are not guaranteed to receive patches.

## Response Targets (best effort)
- Acknowledge receipt: within 3 business days.
- Initial assessment/triage: within 7 days.
- Fix, mitigation, or coordinated disclosure plan: within 30 days, depending on severity and complexity.

## Scope
- Applies to code and configurations contained in this repository.
- Hosting/provider incidents, user-generated content, and third-party dependencies are typically out of scope but will be reviewed case-by-case.

## Disclosure and Credit
- We will coordinate a disclosure date once a fix or mitigation is ready.
- With your permission, we are happy to credit reporters in release notes or advisories.
